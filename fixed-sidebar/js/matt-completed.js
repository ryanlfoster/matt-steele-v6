the corresponding part of the page smoothly. */

whether the document.location object contains a hash (or at least, contains a hash that
is not an empty string).

If it does, we obtain the hash, get the number of the <section>, and calculate the offset
from the top of the page in the same way that we have done in previous tasks. We then
set the scrollTop of the page to 0 to force the browser to the top of the page. We also
remove the hash at this point.

Finally we can call our scrollPage() function, passing in the new href fragment, the
amount of scroll required, and set the final argument to true so that the correct hash
fragment is added back to the browser's location bar. It should all happen so quickly that the
user does not notice that the page load has been intercepted and the behavior modified. */

scroll. We don't need to prevent the default behavior of the browser this time, and the href
variable is set using the document.location.hash property as it will be the back button

fragment in the address bar of the browser. To handle this, we use a JavaScript ternary
construct that checks whether the target variable that we just defined has a falsey value,

zero. If it doesn't, we determine the required scroll amount in the same way as we did before. */
