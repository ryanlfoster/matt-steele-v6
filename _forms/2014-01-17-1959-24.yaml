  Hi Matt - I ran across your profile on LinkedIn and reviewing your impressive experience thought you’d be a great person to reach out to about a terrific opportunity.  We seek a technically savvy and intellectually curious Senior Front End developer who is passionate about development and who loves taking on new challenges.  The focus is on developing client-side functionality, so we seek a JavaScript expert with an architectural focus.  
  
  Our client is a well funded rapidly growing start-up on a mission to make a real difference in people\'s lives, offers terrific compensation, leading-edge technology, and a great team environment.  Please note: this is a full-time role (perm with full benefits, not a contract) work from home role.  
  
  Let’s have a short call together to see if this grabs you. Reply with your availability and contact info or get on my calendar by visiting https://www.timetrade.com/book/PRVMP so we can speak in confidence at your convenience; I am available after hours as well.  I look forward to your reply. 
  
  Thank you.  Greg
