  <p>Over the course of the&nbsp;past month I&#39;ve been spending my evenings and weekends learning Ruby on Rails. I&#39;ve always been curious about it, but only recently have some upcoming projects at work prompted me to take a deeper dive&nbsp;and finally learn it properly. I&#39;m thouroughly enjoying it thus far. Being a front-end guy who works in rails apps and a few CMS&#39;s, I don&#39;t feel like a complete noob. I understand the basic concepts and structure. The specific syntax and routing are more of interest to me.</p>
  
  <p>Thus far, I&#39;ve been going step-by-step though Michael Hartl&#39;s Learning Ruby On Rails book with great success. It&#39;s a fanatastic book that walks the user step by step through setting up a few apps and getting in the practice of test driven development.&nbsp;</p>
