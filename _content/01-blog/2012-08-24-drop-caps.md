  <p>Drop caps can add a nice touch to blog posts, or any written material for that matter. They&rsquo;ve been around for over two thousand years, stretching back all the way to Roman times. They add a bit of style and are a visual cue to the reader that a new idea is starting . Daily Drop Cap is a great resource to see what&rsquo;s possible.</p>

  <p>Creating drop caps in modern software programs such as Word (shown here), or Photoshop isn&rsquo;t nearly as fanciful or customized as handwritten drop caps, but they still add a nice bit of style to paragraphs.</p>

  <p>Drop caps with CSS</p>
  
  <p>On the web there are a number of methods to get a drop cap working, including image replacement and Javascript techniques, but how do I create them purely using CSS? What I found was that there is no simple answer to fit all situations, but the first-of-type:first-letter pseudo class is the method that I ended up using.</p>
  
  <p>Here is how the drop caps are styled on this page:</p>
  
  <pre>.main-article p:first-of-type:first-letter{ 
    float: left; 
    color: #333; 
    font-size: 75px; 
    line-height: 60px; 
    padding: 4px 8px 0 3px; 
    text-shadow: 1px 1px #7ea2ca, 2px 2px #cb5432; 
  }
  </pre>
  
  <p>The first-of-type:first-letter selector means &ldquo;select the first letter of the first paragraph&rdquo;, which in this case worked perfectly</p>
  
  <p>There is a also a WordPress plugin if you happen to be on that platform, although I think it&rsquo;s best just to style it in CSS if you can. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend installing a plugin just for this purpose. It would just add plug-in bloat and may not be as semantic.</p>
