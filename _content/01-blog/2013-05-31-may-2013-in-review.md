  <p><em>During 2013 I&#39;m going to keep a regular blog series where I summarize what I&#39;ve been working on during the past month. I have reminders set on my calendar and everything, so I&#39;ll never miss one, right?</em></p>
  
  <p>What a month May was! There&#39;s been a lot of changes in my life and things are really starting to come together for me.</p>
  
  <p>I made a wish list a while back of the type of the place I wanted to work with.</p>
  
  <p><strong>The perfect company:</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  	<li>A leader in the development community - Writing, teaching, sharing, conferences; these are all important to me</li>
  	<li>A environment that encourages continued learning - both the company and myself should never be stagnant</li>
  	<li>They have an office we can all work from when needed - I like working with people in the same office at least part of the time</li>
  	<li>Projects that give me challenges (and the space to work through them)</li>
  	<li>Working with other developers - I like having other developers to talk shop with</li>
  	<li>No mention of ping pong tables or free beer in their search for a developer - I like these things as much as the next guy, but I&#39;m more interested in doing work I&#39;m proud of than what&#39;s in the company fridge</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>Bonuses:</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  	<li>Expression Engine - I can work in any CMS, but my CMS of choice is Expression Engine. I&#39;d like to find an EE-based company</li>
  	<li>Ruby on Rails - I don&#39;t know Ruby on Rails (yet), but I&#39;ve gone through a few courses on Ruby, and would love an excuse to learn more</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>I found a company in the middle of May that hit every single one of these bullet points! I emailed them on a Sunday night, and by the next Monday I was contracting for them. I&#39;m a few weeks in now and I couldn&#39;t be happier:)</p>
  
  <p>If things go well, it could lead to full-time work, so I&#39;m on a learning spree to get up-to-date on all the projects and help anywhere I can. I know a lot, but there&#39;s always something <em>more</em> to learn. In particular, the more advanced parts of Expression Engine I need to get up to speed on, but that will come with time. Just last night I was up late learning the finer points of customizing WYGWAM.</p>
  
  <h2>I was interviewed for a podcast</h2>
  
  <p>My friend <a href="http://ttimsmith.com/">Tim Smith</a> interviewed me for <a href="http://theeastwing.net/">his fantastic podcast</a> earlier this month. We talked about my journey through making a career change, Code Scouts, putting yourself out there to get noticed, and living in Minnesota. It was a lot of fun and I was honored to be on amongst all the more famous people he interviews on his show. It&#39;s led to meeting some really nice folks after the show was released. Thanks, Tim!</p>
  
  <h2>Code Scouts is now in a CMS</h2>
  
  <p><a href="http://codescouts.net/">Code Scouts</a> was initially built on just flat HTML files, which worked fine, but I knew that if I wanted to continue creating screencasts for it, I should get it into a CMS. I went to a local WordCamp at the very end of April, so when I got home I figured I&#39;d brush up on my WP skills and put Code Scouts in it. It&#39;s fine there for now, but I have plans to move it over to a new CMS called <a href="http://buildwithcraft.com/">Craft</a> when it gets released. (I made a <a href="http://vimeo.com/61232917">short screencast</a> on getting Craft up and running locally a few months back).</p>
  
  <h2>Plans for June</h2>
  
  <p>My #1 and only goal for June is to knock it out of the park with the company I&#39;m contracting for. I&#39;ve put all my side projects and any other learning on hold for now. I really just want to concentrate on this new job and any challenges it brings.</p>
  
  <p>I&#39;m building, learning, working hard, and I couldn&#39;t be happier. Lets see what June brings!</p>
