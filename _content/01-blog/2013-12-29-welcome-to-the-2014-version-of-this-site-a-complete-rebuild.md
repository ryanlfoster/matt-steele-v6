  <p>What you&#39;re seeing here is the annual update of this site. It&#39;s always good to rearrange the furniture...or completely trash the old stuff and start from scratch every year as I do. I don&#39;t know the exact number of redesigns of this site has had because the first few were amateur at best, and therefore never counted. I&#39;ve likely created 8 total versions. Each one better than the last.</p>
  
  <p>One version was even created by my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/JarrodBallou">Jarrod</a> in Flash at some point (maybe 2004?). It was awesome at the time (Thanks, Jarrod. You inadvertently set me on a path that would change my career/life).</p>
  
  <h2>So what&#39;s new?</h2>
  
  <p>In a word: everything. A new design, a new code re-write from the ground up, and a new CMS. As with any developer, the way I write code is different from 14 months ago and the last version started to look a little stale. For me, watching myself get&nbsp;better at coding is the best part of being a developer. Christmas break always seems like a good time to dive in and do a re-write, which is exactly what I did this year.</p>
  
  <h3>New Code</h3>
  
  <p>One of the most important things I&#39;ve learned since the last build is how important a strong foundation is for a site is. This time around I started with a <a href="http://matt-steele.dev/styleguide">styleguide</a> and built up from there. In the previous version I found myself doing a lot of &#39;patching&#39;. A style would come up that I hadn&#39;t prepared ahead for and I would need to get into the code and patch it up. Not so on this version; this version has strong &#39;bones&#39;. I think I could throw anything at it at this point. Being able to plan ahead just comes with experience.</p>
  
  <h3>New CMS</h3>
  
  <p>Expression Engine was the foundation for the previous version of this site. It was my first EE build though, and after building many more since, I started to notice things that I would have done differently. Nothing was done &#39;wrong&#39; per se, but there were parts that could have been more efficient.</p>
  
  <p>This site is now built on <a href="http://statamic.com/">Statamic</a>, which I really enjoy working with. It&#39;s my CMS of choice for sites that are this size and even a bit larger. Among the many benefits are that there&#39;s no database to be compromised and the entire site can be put into version control. I can make updates to my local copy and simply commit the changes and copy them over to the live version when I&#39;m ready. Also, the control panel UI is well-designed and just an overall nice user experience. I was interviewed recently about my use of Statamic, which you can find <a href="http://themetaq.com/articles/statamic-series-matt-steele">here</a>.</p>
  
  <h3>Design</h3>
  
  <p>The previous design wasn&#39;t bad at all, but after 14 months of looking at it, I was starting to want to see something different. This will likely happen all over again next year. For reference of what v5 looked like see the <a href="http://matt-steele.dev/colophon">colophon</a>. The updates on this version include a red, white and blue color palette, larger text, and updated profile info. Overall, it does a better job letting people know who I am and what I do.</p>
  
  <h2>Wrap up</h2>
  
  <p>It always feels good to get a new site released, but even more so when it&#39;s your own. This is a fresh start from the ground up so, as always, if you run into something weird please do me a favor and shoot me an email. It&#39;s much appreciated. Here&#39;s to 2014!</p>
