  <p><em>During 2013 I’m going to keep a regular blog series where I summarize what I’ve been working on during the past month. I have reminders set on my calendar and everything, so I’ll never miss one, right?</em></p>
  
  <p>A big realization that I had recently was that I was all over the place when it came to what I was working on. In addition to front-end work, I was attending PHP meetups, taking Ruby classes, learning Javascript frameworks and researching CMS's. There’s a lot out there to learn and I can quickly find myself going down a lot of rabbit holes if I'm not careful.</p>
  
  <p>January has seen me refocused, cutting out learning the technologies that aren’t relevant to the task at hand, and focusing solely on two things: building sites and expanding my knowledge pure Javascript. That’s it. I’ll put off Ruby and PHP and CMS’s until I need them.</p>
  
  <p>Javascript has been a HUGE part of January for me. I picked up “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Enlightenment-Cody-Lindley/dp/1449342884">Javascript Enlightenment</a>” by Cody Lindley at the beginning of the month and it has done wonders to help me understand the language more clearly. I’m really excited to finally be ‘getting’ a lot of it now. Each day brings a new lightbulb moment it seems. I've been writing a lot of Javascript lately and am really enjoying it.</p>
  
  <p>I've also been building sites that are quite different than what I’ve built in the past, which has been a lot of fun. SMACSS, OOCSS and CSS architecture have helped me to rethink the way I build sites and I’m really enjoying incorporating all of these new methods.</p>
  
  <p>A new set of tutorials I’ve recently discovered (and quickly went through) are at <a href="http://build-podcast.com/">build-podcast.com</a>. They're very well made and show quite a range of technologies. I’d like to start creating some screencasts myself and I'm finding these to be very good.</p>
  
  <h2>Blog posts this month:</h2>
  
  <p>'<a href="http://matt-steele.com/blog/single/looking-for-a-front-end-development-mentor">Looking for a front-end development mentor</a>' – I wrote about finding others to work with and learn from. People tend to learn best when they have someone to bounce ideas off or challenge the way they approach decisions. I’d like to work with other people.</p>
  
  <p>'<a href="http://matt-steele.com/blog/single/my-javascript-ah-ha-moment">My ah-ha! moment with Javascript</a>' – This post created the biggest spike in traffic my humble little blog has ever received. Thanks to everyone who retweeted the link!</p>
  
  <p>'<a href="http://matt-steele.com/blog/build-your-own-framework">Build your own framework</a>' – I started to see TONS of questions on Stackoverflow from beginners who are using CSS/HTML frameworks such as Twitter Bootstrap, Foundation, Bones, ect. While these frameworks have their place, I really think people should build their own frameworks so they understand the code they're using inside and out.</p>
  
  <h2>Launched:</h2>
  
  <p><a href="http://camp-supply.com/">camp-supply.com</a></p>
  
  <p>All-in-all a very productive month. I’m extremely happy with the last 30 days. My goals for the next month are:</p>
  
  <p>1. More Javascript</p>
  
  <p>2. More sites</p>
  
  <p>3. Work more at self-promotion.</p>
