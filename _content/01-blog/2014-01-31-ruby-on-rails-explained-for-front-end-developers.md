  <p>Over the course of the past month I&#39;ve been spending my evenings and weekends learning Ruby on Rails. I&#39;ve always been curious about Rails, but only recently have had some upcoming projects at work prompted me to take a deeper dive and finally learn it properly.</p>
  
  <p>Although I am a Front-end Developer, I&nbsp;thoroughly enjoying understanding&nbsp;the &#39;other side&#39; of web development. Learning how data is created and moved around in the backend is quite fascinating to me. I wrote a bit more about it <a href="http://matt-steele.com/blog/diving-into-ruby-on-rails">here</a>, if you&#39;re interested.</p>
  
  <p>Being a front-end guy who works around Rails,&nbsp;I don&#39;t feel like a complete noob. I understand the basic concepts and structure of the MVC pattern. It&#39;s the&nbsp;specific syntax and test driven development where my learning curve lies.</p>
  
  <p>Thus far in my training I&#39;ve been going though Michael Hartl&#39;s &#39;<a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Learning Ruby On Rails</a>&#39; book. It&#39;s a fantastic book that walks the user step-by-step through getting&nbsp;the ubiquitous twitter-style app up and running&nbsp;(kind of the &#39;Hello World&#39; of Rails development). I&#39;ve also signed up for a number of both Ruby and Rails events here in town to meet other folks that are working in Rails. My goal is to be able to call myself a Rails developer at some point. I think I&#39;m well on my way.</p>
  
  <p>Last week I ran across a new book that may have been written just for me. &quot;<a href="https://leanpub.com/rorfrontend">Ruby On Rails Explained for Front-End Developers</a>&quot; by <a href="https://twitter.com/nowmiles">Miles Matthias</a> has a title that made me pick up as soon as I saw it released. It&#39;s a short e-book at just 17 pages, but&nbsp;what it lacks in depth it makes up for in breaking down the basics of the structure of Ruby on Rails in a short, concise manner. In fact, I&#39;ve enjoyed it&#39;s to-the-point brevity so much that&nbsp;I&#39;ve actually printed it out and keep it tucked into the Hartl book. They&#39;re both&nbsp;heavily marked up and highlighted.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Due&nbsp;to&nbsp;my prior experience, much&nbsp;of the information simply&nbsp;serves&nbsp;as a reminder to me about the structure and purpose of each peice of the Rails environment. I&#39;ve found myself using it mostly as a reference when going through the more in-depth Hartl book. That isn&#39;t a knock on the book. Quite the contrary; it serves as the perfect companion to it. For instance, if I need to remind myself how cache busting works, I can quickly flip to a page in Matthias&#39; book rather than digging through the much larger &#39;Learning Ruby on Rails&#39;.&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>If you&#39;re a Front-end Developer that needs to get your hands dirty every now and then and venture outside of the &#39;Views&#39; folder to figure out what the heck the &#39;Asset Pipeline&#39; is, then this book was written just for you. On the other hand, if you&#39;re looking for a deeper dive into Rails, then I recommended picking up Hartl&#39;s book and using &#39;Ruby on Rails Explained for Front-End Developers&#39; as a reference, just as I am.</p>
