  <p>Early in the Summer I took my first steps in what would become the greatest journey of my life. Africa, and the beasts that inhabit its lands were not on my mind when I finally let go of my soured marriage. But, as the days of being on my own began to grow on me, I also began thinking of adventure.</p>
  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>As a middle aged man with a well paying job in the suburbs of Atlanta, I had no real business traveling to a strange foreign land half a world away...which is exactly why I decided to go.</p>

  <p>The park was empty. No one was there. By the position of the sun he could tell it was either early morning or late afternoon.The smell of the flowers and grass, the dampness of the leaves, indicated morning. It had been late afternoon when the tornado had picked him up. And the sky had been overcast and cloudy.</p>

  <p>This past year was full of changes for me professionally. I&#39;ve had an incredible year. The biggest change was starting a new job and moving a 1000 miles away in July. It was a fantastic move.</p>
  
  <p>Before I set out my goals for 2014, I want to look back at goals I set at this time last year and see how I did.</p>
  
  <h2>2013 Review</h2>
  
  <p>Here&#39;s my 2013 report card:</p>
  
  <h3>1. Build, Build, Build - SUCCESS</h3>
  
  <p>I built a ton of sites in 2013. Likely more than I ever have in any previous year. Knocked this out of the park.</p>
  
  <h3>2. More meetups/conferences - SUCCESS</h3>
  
  <p>Not only did I attend more meetups, I started one of my own. When I moved to Denver mid-year I needed a way to meet other developers and learn JavaScript, so <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Denver-Code-Club/">Denver Code Club</a> was born.</p>
  
  <p>I attended 3 conferences this year. Earlier in the year I went to <a href="http://www.midwestphp.com/">MidWest PHP</a> and <a href="http://minnestar.org/minnebar/">Minnebar</a> in Minnesota. Then, in October, I went to <a href="http://2013.cssdevconf.com/">CSS Dev Conf</a> up in the Rockies.</p>
  
  <h3>3. Write More&nbsp;- NEEDS TO IMPROVE</h3>
  
  <p>I did ok here. Just ok though. I wrote 10 out of 12 month-in-reviews, missing a few months when I moved in July. I was just too dang busy with moving and starting a new job. I&#39;ve picked it back up the last couple months though. Thank you to all 12 of you that read them :)</p>
  
  <p>I&#39;ve wrote a few articles over at <a href="http://themetaq.com/queue/contributor/199220">MetaQ</a> as well. I&#39;ll likely keep the bulk of my writing there for now since it has a much larger audience than this site.</p>
  
  <h3>4. Cut out the noise - SUCCESS</h3>
  
  <p>I did a really good job at cutting out unnecessary noise this past year. I unsubscribed to a lot of newsletters, got my Twitter follows down to reasonable amount and started using a timer as a method to keep on task. I&#39;m also a lot more knowledgeable on <em>where</em> to get information. It&#39;s easier to drink from a straw than from a firehose.</p>
  
  <h2>2014 Goals</h2>
  
  <p>I only have three goals for 2014.They&#39;re a bit more focused this time around. I know what I want and I think these will get me there.</p>
  
  <h3>1. Q</h3>
  
  <p>I&#39;m incredibly lucky to work where I do. It&#39;s a fantastic little company and I want to help out in any way I can to grow the company and help it become more successful. We have some great plans for 2014 and it&#39;ll be fun to be part of it.</p>
  
  <h3>2. Freelance</h3>
  
  <p>I have a lot more spare time during the evenings and weekends than what I used to. I love web development and I wouldn&#39;t mind doing more in my spare time, so why not? Time is a luxury I might not always have, so it&#39;s best to take advantage of it while I do.</p>
  
  <h3>3. More JavaScript</h3>
  
  <p>I made great strides in learning JavaScript this past year. I know FAR more than I did this time last year. I think the meetup group was a huge part of that. That said, I want an even deeper understanding of it. I already have plans to continue the meetup in 2014. This goal will be fun to look back at in a year.</p>
  
  <h3>Wrap-up</h3>
  
  <p>I had a big year, hit most of my goals, and have some good goals set for the coming year. Thanks for reading! On to 2014!</p>
  
  <p>If you read this and write out your own goals, please let me know. I&#39;d love to read them!</p>
