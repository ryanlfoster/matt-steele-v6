  <p>This site has been designed and redesigned a number of times, and here is the latest version.</p>
  
  <p>The version that you’re looking at now is by far the biggest leap I’ve had in terms of development. My skills as a developer have jumped dramatically since the last version, so it was past time for my personal site to be up-to-date.</p>
  
  <h2><em><strong>Here are a few highlighted changes:</strong></em></h2>
  
  <h2><strong>New code from the ground up</strong></h2>
  
  <p>I think that your old code should bother you. Or, I should say that you should be constantly learning and improving, and the code you wrote a year ago should not be the same code that you’d write today. You should be a better developer than you were at any point. There's always new ways to improve. &nbsp;I hope that a year from now I’ll look back at this code and see ways to improve it. This means I’m learning, which should never stop.</p>
  
  <h2><strong>Better responsive implementation</strong></h2>
  
  <p>The previous version was my first attempt at responsive design, and while the site was indeed responsive, there were parts of the code that I started to learn could have been written better. There were a few nits here and there that started to add up in my mind. In particular, I used “display: hidden;” in a few places where I didn’t need to. I hadn’t yet learned to reflow CSS in a more graceful way, rather than just hide parts of it. That’s been fixed here.</p>
  
  <p>I‘ve also learned about, and come to love, *box-sizing: border-box;. I believe that this is how the box model should have worked from the beginning, and incorporating it to this site made coding much more intuitive. I’ll be using it on all the sites I build from here on out.</p>
  
  <p>This version also gave me the chance to write my media queries as em-based units rather than pixels, which is to allow the site to respond at relative sizes to the browser width, instead of rigid specific sizes. It just makes sense to have the media queries be as fluid as the design they contain.</p>
  
  <h2><strong>New design pieces</strong></h2>
  
  <p>The redesign also gave me a place to use font icons, which I’ve only recently learned about and absolutely love. In fact, I may be in danger of making fonts out of everything. Icomoon is a great resource to build icons out of whatever you can think of. The icons here come from the noun project. I’ve kept the same color palette, which I‘ve always been quite happy with, but I’ve changed fonts (again).</p>
  
  <h2><strong>Git</strong></h2>
  
  <p>My code is now under version control and up on Git. This too was a small learning curve, but I figured it out with the help of a Lynda.com and Code School courses. I picked up Tower after hearing people praise it, and it has really helped in understanding Git. I think I was able to learn it faster by using the GUI and seeing the way my commits were working. I’ve also signed up for Beanstalk, but haven’t quite figured out the workflow of working locally and then being able to push my site and database live and then keeping them in sync.</p>
  
  <p>That’s a high level overview of some of the changes. I’ll follow up with more specific info on what I’ve been learning and the resources I’ve been using in the weeks to come.</p>
