  <p>Recently, I&#39;ve been digging deep into the world of CSS architecture. It&#39;s an absolutely fascinating topic that&#39;s led me to is a complete re-thinking of the way I&#39;ve been starting site builds.</p>
  
  <p>I normally have a folder on my desktop titled &#39;base&#39; that contains a starter .css file and a starter .html file, both largely blank. However, a problem started to arise in that the way I approach site builds has completely changed; my humble &#39;base&#39; folder was nowhere near the toolset I needed it to be.</p>
  
  <p>For one, I build with Sass now, which allows me to work with code in a few different chunks, and then compile them all before it goes live. I <em>really</em> like this approach, and it has lent itself well to a deeper understanding of just how <a href="http://smacss.com/">SMACSS</a> and <a href="http://oocss.org/">OOCSS</a> work. I now feel like I&#39;m reaching for a certain tool ONLY when it&#39;s needed. It allows me to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separate my concerns</a> and I really like working in this more organized manner.</p>
  
  <p>The other change that has occurred is that I&#39;ve been using Github to track my code. It makes sense that if I&#39;m using an evolving starter file, it should be on Github and under version control as well.</p>
  
  <p>So I rebuilt my base folder after digging through <a href="http://csswizardry.com/">Harry Roberts&#39;</a> <a href="https://github.com/csswizardry/vanilla">Vanilla</a> and taking out the portions that I needed. I&#39;ve called it Pathfinder and put it up on <a href="https://github.com/matt-steele/Pathfinder">Github</a> so that I can iterate on it as my needs change; a living starter file if you will.</p>
  
  <p>Largely, I&#39;ve found this to be a great learning tool. The act of taking another persons work apart, and then reassembling it is a tried and true method of figuring out just about how almost anything works. I can remember taking apart my parents tape deck when I was a kid and putting it all back together. Same idea, really.</p>
  
  <p>If you want to learn how I work, please clone it and dig through it. Go line-by-line until you understand just what each piece of the code does. Or, for a more comprehensive framework, check out Vanilla. Of course, if you see anything in my code that can be improved, please let me know; it would be much appreciated.</p>
