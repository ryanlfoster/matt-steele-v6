  <p>On Tuesday, after a lengthy development process, Blocks CMS was finally released as a Beta to the public and renamed <a href="http://pixelandtonic.com/">Craft CMS</a>. &nbsp;The guys behind Craft, <a href="http://pixelandtonic.com/">Pixel &amp; Tonic</a>, are well know in the Expression Engine community for creating high quality, essential add-ons for that platform, so this release has been eagerly anticipated.</p>
  
  <p>I downloaded it yesterday, spent a few hours digging around in it, and so far I&#39;m really impressed. It&#39;s in Beta, so there are sure to be some kinks to iron out, although I haven&#39;t noticed any yet.</p>
  
  <p>I just bought a microphone and some screencasting software, so I thought a quick little video showing the installation process would be a great way to break in my Vimeo account and test out the microphone.</p>
  
  <p>It turns out the microphone has a defect in it that makes me sound like a frog. Ha!</p>
