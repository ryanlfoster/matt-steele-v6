  <p><em>During 2013 I&#39;m going to keep a regular blog series where I summarize what I&#39;ve been working on during the past month. I have reminders set on my calendar and everything, so I&#39;ll never miss one, right?</em></p>
  
  <p>What a ride June 2013 was! As I write this I&#39;m sitting in an empty apartment in Minneapolis, all my belongings having been packed up and shipped off to Denver a few days ago. I&#39;ll be there myself in 2 days.</p>
  
  <h2>New job</h2>
  
  <p>As of July 1, I&#39;m a Front-End Developer at <a href="http://www.qdigitalstudio.com/">Q Digital Studio</a> in Denver! Q is a small studio that develops <a href="http://brew.by/">Brew.by</a>(rails app), writes the web magazine&nbsp;<a href="http://themetaq.com/">Meta Q</a>&nbsp;(which if you&#39;re a designer/developer you should absolutely bookmark), and client work. I couldn&#39;t have asked to find a better company. They&#39;re a great group of people to work with and I&#39;m excited to get to the office and dig into more projects.</p>
  
  <h2>New city</h2>
  
  <p>Denver! The front-range! Steps from the Rockies!</p>
  
  <p>My girlfriend and I took a little road trip last summer and visited Colorado; half window-shopping for a new home and half just wanting to get the heck out of Minneapolis. We visited Boulder, Denver, and camped for a few days up in the Rockies. It was beautiful. We loved it and talked on the drive home about what steps we could make to move there. A year later, we&#39;re heading to Colorado for good.</p>
  
  <h2>Goodbye Minneapolis</h2>
  
  <p>Minneapolis was a shot in the dark. Try something new. Live somewhere completely different from where you&#39;re from. Get out of your comfort zone and start new in a place where you don&#39;t have any connections, or know anyone at all.</p>
  
  <p>I was looking for something different than San Francisco, where I had spent the last 12 years of my life, and Minneapolis certainly fit the bill. I&#39;m really grateful to have tried it out, but after 2 years of living here, I&#39;m happy to be headed back West. It wasn&#39;t a bad place, but it just never felt like &#39;home&#39; (It&#39;s not you, it&#39;s me (but really it&#39;s you)). See ya, Minneapolis.</p>
  
  <h2>New Computer</h2>
  
  <p>Oh, yeah! I&#39;m finally on a laptop! I was on a Mac Mini before, which was a great little machine. The only problem with the Mac Mini was that I was never able to go sit at a coffee shop and work for the day, or attend any local hackathons. I was always tied to my desk at home. I had money saved and was waiting for the new MacBook Air, so as soon as they were released last week, I went out and picked one up. It&#39;s super fast and light, but best of all, it&#39;s portable.</p>
  
  <h2>Looking forward</h2>
  
  <p>That&#39;s June 2013 for me! Really my best month yet. July is definitely going to be busy with a new job and a new city explore. I&#39;m excited about these new beginnings and for what the future will bring. Life is great.</p>

### A Paragraph

This is a paragraph of text which has all the most common html elements in it such as the **strong element** which is used to give text strong importance. You could of course use the <b>b element</b> which represents a span of text stylistically different from normal text, without conveying any special importance or relevance. The <mark>mark element</mark> which represents highlighted text, i.e., a run of text marked for reference purposes. *The HTML em element marks text that has stress emphasis.* You could of course use the <i>i element</i> which represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, for example, technical terms, foreign language phrases, or fictional character thoughts. <i>It is typically displayed in italic type</i>. The next piece of text is marked up using the code element `function()` and finally links will be styled [like this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/a).
