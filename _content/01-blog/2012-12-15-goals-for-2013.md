  <p>Man, I learned a ton of things during 2012! Just thinking back to what I didn't know a year ago is amazing. This year I went through a HUGE leap in my knowledge of web development. I already know that 2013 will definitely be another huge leap.</p>
  
  <p>Earlier today I was thinking about making some goals for myself, and I can think of no better way to keep myself accountable to the 10's of people who read this blog than to write those goals down.</p>
  
  <h2>#1 Build, Build, Build</h2>
  
  <p>I try to build something everyday, and that has to continue into 2013. My problem seems to be focusing on what to build at one time. Time is my most precious commodity, and sometimes I'll find myself wasting it answering <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1762015/matt-steele">Wordpress Stack Overflow</a> questions, or getting lost exploring CMS's, or watching <a href="http://video training">video training</a> for 6 hours. These are all great things to spend time on, but they're not building.</p>
  
  <h2>#2 - More meetups/conferences</h2>
  
  <p>I lived in one area my entire life up until two years ago. Moving cross-country has made my social circle very small. I've been actively trying to change this. Last year I attended two conferences and probably close to 20 meetups. I'll increase this in 2013. I've already signed up for the <a href="http://www.midwestphp.com/">Midwest PHP Conference</a> and a <a href="http://elasticbackflip.com/blog/2012/12/12/rails-bootcamp-ruby-basics-and-scaffolding/">Rails Bootcamp</a> and I'll likely be adding more as the year goes on.</p>
  
  <h2>#3 - Write</h2>
  
  <p>This ties to my lack of time, but I need to make it a priority as well. Every time I learn something I get a <em>far</em> deeper understanding of it when I sit down and write it out. The fact that people may or may not be reading it is almost irrelevant. Simply put: writing about development makes me a better developer. I would also love to teach down the road, and writing will eventually make me a better teacher.</p>
  
  <h2>#4 Cut out the noise</h2>
  
  <p>Anything that gets in the way of building or learning is just noise, and I'm actively taking steps to cut it out of my world. I've never been into social networks, but I do have a <a href="https://twitter.com/mattsteeele">Twitter account</a> to try and follow industry leaders. Unfortunately, this had a side effect of me reading about so-and-so's political beliefs and their airport frustrations and so on. I really dislike complaining, and Twitter can be just a wall of complaints from people you would otherwise admire. I'm unfollowing all the complainers/political pundits/religious folks.</p>
  
  <p>So, my three word summary from the above list would be:</p>
  
  <h2>People, build &amp; focus</h2>
  
  <p>All three are obviously very important to me and I'm really looking forward to the coming year.</p>
  
  <p>So much to learn and build! In fact, I'm going to focus on #1 right now.</p>
