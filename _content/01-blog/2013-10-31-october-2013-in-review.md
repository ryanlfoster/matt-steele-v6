  <p><em>During 2013 I&#39;m going to keep a regular blog series where I summarize what I&#39;ve been working on during the past month. I have reminders set on my calendar and everything, so I&#39;ll never miss one, right?</em></p>
  
  <p>October was yet another good month for me. I spent a lot of time building sites and continuing to learn more and more.</p>
  
  <p>Earlier in the month I wrote <a href="http://themetaq.com/articles/selling-statamic-to-clients">an article</a> on how we sell <a href="http://www.statamic.com/">Statamic</a> to clients at <a href="http://www.qdigitalstudio.com/">Q Digital Studio</a>. It&#39;s a fantastic little CMS thats perfect for small to medium sized sites. We stick to Expression Engine for the larger and more complex sites, but Statamic has been our tool of choice otherwise.</p>
  
  <p>I&#39;ve organized a meet up here in Denver called <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Denver-Code-Club/">Denver Code Club</a>. Outside of work, I spend <em>a lot</em>&nbsp;of time on my own learning various web technologies. Learning by myself is great, and has gotten me this far, but I was looking for a way to find other people to study with.</p>
  
  <p>Back in June I started to Follow Richard Bovell&#39;s &#39;<a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/">How to Learn JavaScript Properly</a>&#39; outline, which laid out 8-9 weeks of intense study to have a deeper understanding of JavaScript. About 4 weeks in though, I started working for Q Digital Studio and moved 1000 miles. With starting a new job starting and moving and all that comes with those things, I had to set JavaScript training aside for a bit. But, now I feel like I&#39;m back in a place time-wise where I can dedicate the needed 20hours/wk that the course deserves. Organizing a meetup has been fun and I look forward to studying other local developers and diving in. I should have a much better grip on JS by the end of the year.</p>
  
  <p>Two weeks ago I was fortunate enough to travel up to Estes Park, CO for 2 days and attend <a href="http://2013.cssdevconf.com/">CSS Dev Conference</a> at the famously haunted Stanley Hotel. The conference was well organized, had great food and a fantastic line-up of speakers, all in likely the most beautiful setting a conference could ever be in. I took a lot of notes home with me and we&#39;re beginning to implement some of the things we learned from the conference here at Q.</p>
  
  <p>The most exciting part of the conference was getting a chance to meet a lot of speakers who I&#39;ve been learning from for years now. It was a pretty good feeling just to have a chance to say &#39;thanks&#39;. Without knowing it, a lot of these folks have had a tremendous effect on my career; helping me make the transition from video to the web. On the second day, I inadvertently sat at a speakers table and got to listen in as some incredibly smart people discuss the web. Overall a great experience, and I hope to return next year.</p>
  
  <p>The conference ended up giving me a lot of thought about how far I&#39;ve come the last few years, which prompted and <a href="http://matt-steele.com/blog/single/specific-things-to-do-to-become-a-web-developer">blog post</a> about some specific things for beginners to do find a job in the industry.</p>
  
  <p>So, that&#39;s a wrap-up for October 2013. All in all I had a great time building, learning, writing and meeting smart people.</p>
  
  <h2>Looking ahead to November</h2>
  
  <p>This coming month will be dedicated to work, which is VERY busy, and in my downtime spending 20hrs/week learning JS and organizing the meetup group. I&#39;m really looking forward to November. Should be a great month.</p>
