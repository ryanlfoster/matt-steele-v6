  <p><em>During 2013 I&rsquo;m going to keep a regular blog series where I summarize what I&rsquo;ve been working on during the past month. I have reminders set on my calendar and everything, so I&rsquo;ll never miss one, right?</em></p>
  
  <p>Man, February went FAST! It&#39;s the shortest month of the year, and it sure felt like it.&nbsp;So, what did I do this month?</p>
  
  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  
  <p>After spending much of January reading <a href="http://www.javascriptenlightenment.com/">JavaScript Enlightenment</a> by Cody Lindley (several times), I purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Effective-JavaScript-Specific-Software-Development/dp/0321812182">Effective JavaScript</a> by David Herman. It&#39;s been a great next step book after reading JavaScript Enlightenment. The book is broken up into 68 small sections that help you to understand the nuances of the language. David gives an excellent <a href="http://javascriptjabber.com/044-jsj-book-club-effective-javascript-with-david-herman/">interview</a> on JavaScript Jabber about the book as well.</p>
  
  <h2>Screencasting</h2>
  
  <p>I really enjoy watching other people work at their craft. It helps my own work to see the differences in others approach. I saw &#39;Happy People: A Year In The Taiga&#39; recently, and it was fantastic to watch a man build a set of skis out of nothing but his hands and the knowledge passed on by his father. It reminded me of Chris Coyier&#39;s article on <a href="http://chriscoyier.net/2012/09/23/working-in-public/">working in public</a>. So, this month I picked up a microphone and will be screencasting my next build.</p>

  <h2>Screencasts I watch:</h2>
  
  <p>Andy Howells is doing excellent work at <a href="http://codeboxers.com/">codeboxers</a></p>
  
  <p>Tim Smith is about to launch <a href="http://timlikestoteach.com/">timlikestoteach</a></p>
  
  <p>Sayanee at <a href="http://build-podcast.com/">build-podcast</a></p>
  
  <p>Chris Coyier continues his great screencasts at <a href="http://css-tricks.com/lodge/">The Lodge</a> (paid)</p>
  
  <h2>Launched</h2>
  
  <p>I launched <a href="http://www.boulderastronomy.com/">Boulder Astronomical Society</a> earlier this month. I visited Boulder this past Summer and really loved the city. I grew up in a town at the edge of the East Bay foothills in California and I really miss being close to the mountains. Boulder reminded me a lot of a college town like Berkeley, but instead of the East Bay hills as a backdrop, it has the Rocky Mountains. Very pretty. I hope to get back there soon.</p>
  
  <h2>Looking ahead to March</h2>
  
  <p>That wraps up February! This weekend I&#39;ll be at a PHP conference and then I&#39;ll settle into March and begin getting my screencasts off the ground.</p>
