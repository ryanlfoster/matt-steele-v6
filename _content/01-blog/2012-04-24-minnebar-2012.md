  <p>I got out of my little code bubble this past Saturday and went to MinneBar. It was well attended with about 1000 people, and I had quiet a lot of fun there.</p>
  
  <p>My biggest takeaway was to keep going to these type of events as they pop up. As anyone who has ever been to a conference knows, the best part of them is being surrounded by other people that are as excited about something as you are. I know all of about 3 people in Minnesota, so it was nice to get out and meet some more.</p>
  
  <p>My highlights for the day were Brad Broulik&rsquo;s talk on&nbsp; jQuery mobile and&nbsp; Chris Coyier&rsquo;s &ldquo;What we don&rsquo;t know&ldquo;, which was a great overview on front-end development. I also stumbled in to a talk on publishing as a result of being lost in the Best Buy HQ&rsquo;s early in the morning, and it ended up being a highlight as well. Part of the fun of the (un)conference style is that you&rsquo;re able to stumble into things you wouldn&rsquo;t normally seek out.</p>
  
  <p>I&rsquo;ll be back again next year for sure.</p>
  
  <p>On to MinneWebCon, which is next week!</p>
