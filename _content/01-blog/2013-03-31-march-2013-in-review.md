  <p><em>During 2013 I'm going to keep a regular blog series where I summarize what I've been working on during the past month. I have reminders set on my calendar and everything, so I'll never miss one, right?</em></p>
  
  <h2>More JavaScript</h2>
  
  <p>This has been a quest for me for awhile now. Since late last year I've been diving head first into JavaScript. I use jQuery for everything, but I would really like to become good at writing pure JS. That's my 2 - 3 year goal; not just be able to write JS, but become *good* at it. I want to build applications with JS. I have no doubt that I'll get there in due time.</p>
  
  <p>In January, I read <a href="http://www.javascriptenlightenment.com/">JavaScript Enlightenment</a>, February saw me read <a href="http://effectivejs.com/">Effective JavaScript</a>, and this month I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-JavaScript-Developers-Nicholas-Zakas/dp/1118026691/ref=dp_ob_image_bk">Professional JavaScript</a>. Reading books is fine and all, but I've definitely reached a point where I've read enough that I <em>get</em> all the concepts, and it's time to apply them to a project. So, I started <a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/">this</a> plan that will see me build and launch a JS application within 8 weeks. It's a huge time commitment, but it'll be worth it. I'm shooting for Memorial Day.</p>
  
  <h2>Teaching</h2>
  
  <p>One of my goals for 2013 is to teach. Another is to do more self promotion; <a href="http://codescouts.net/">Code Scouts</a> is a way for me to do both of these&nbsp; at the same time. In a series of 6 videos, I'm walking beginners through the basics of creating a site from scratch. It's a lot of fun and gets me back to doing a bit of editing, which I used to do a ton of. I've got the first two videos up as of this writing, and hope to have it all wrapped up before my next end-of-the-month blog post.</p>
  
  <p>A nice side effect from screencasting is hearing myself speak. Embarrassingly, I sound a lot better in my own head than I do when I actually hear my recorded voice. I need to annunciate my words better, slow down, and not mumble. I also need to relax a bit and not be so serious. Allow myself to be myself if you will. It'll come over time, as long as I keep at it. I think most people struggle with this at first. I'll get there. Realizing all this now will make me a better public speaker in the long run.</p>
  
  <h2>Looking for a job</h2>
  
  <p>I'm looking for a Front-End Developer job! Anywhere in the U.S. I built a <a href="http://hiremattsteele.com/">site</a> this past week to promote myself and get the word out. I'm hoping that my next end-of-the-month blog post has me listing a new job!</p>
  
  <p>Also, wrote a blog <a href="http://matt-steele.com/blog/single/why-im-screencasting-my-work-and-why-you-should-try-it-out-too">post</a> on screencasting and why I think more people should do it.</p>
  
  <p>So, there's my March 2013. April 2013 will see me headed to a few conferences, finishing out Code Scouts, and a month further into my JavaScript project.</p>
  
  <p>Thanks for readingâ€¦and blog what you've been up to this past month. I'd love to read about it.</p>
