  <p><em>During 2013 I&#39;m going to keep a regular blog series where I summarize what I&#39;ve been working on during the past month. I have reminders set on my calendar and everything, so I&#39;ll never miss one, right?</em></p>
  
  <h2>Screencast series complete!</h2>
  
  <p>I finished up my first screencasting series on <a href="http://codescouts.net/">Code Scouts</a>! This project ended up taking a lot more work and time than I initially thought it would, but I&#39;m glad that I did it because I&#39;ve learned so much. I essentially built the site to host the videos, then re-built it while recording the videos. I also had to spend some money for the mic, boom arm, software, ect. The benefits I think will be well worth it in the end though. It was a lot of fun.</p>
  
  <h2>What I learned:</h2>
  
  <p>Promoting myself&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>One reason for starting the screencasts was to show people how I code, and that I&#39;m good at what I do. People will hire you to do the work that they see you doing. I&#39;m an unknown developer, so I need to promote myself and become known. Maybe Code Scouts will introduce me to people I didn&#39;t know before. &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Matt. I&#39;m a developer. Here&#39;s some videos of me working. If you like what you see, let&#39;s work together.&quot;</p>
  
  <p>The best way to learn is to teach&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>I knew this going in and it definitely proved to be true. I know the technology inside and out, but there&#39;s something about the act of explaining to other people that allows you to examine it from a different angle. Sometimes just talking it out made me realize that I could have approached something differently.</p>
  
  <h2>Job hunt</h2>
  
  <p>I&#39;m still on the lookout for the right job. I&#39;ve had some good talks with a few companies, but haven&#39;t found the right fit yet. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m being too picky or not, but I really want to work for a company I&#39;m excited about. I want to do work that I&#39;m proud of. I think it&#39;s best to wait for the right one.</p>
  
  <h2>Conferences</h2>
  
  <p>Minnebar&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>I went to Minnebar again this year, but was only able to make it to the final talk of the day. Luckily, the talk was by my friend <a href="http://timothybsmith.com/">Tim Smith</a>, who had a great presentation on side projects. Side projects are essential to finding the work you love and Tim proves that.</p>
  
  <p>WordCamp</p>
  
  <p>I&#39;ve been to lots of WordPress meetups, but this was my first WordCamp, and it was a great experience. Fantastic talks throughout the day helped to get me excited again about working in Wordpress. One particular talk about freelancing by <a href="https://twitter.com/reidpeifer">Reid Peifer</a> stuck with me and has been on my mind ever since. I may just start taking the freelance route myself.</p>
  
  <h2>Looking forward to May</h2>
  
  <p>I&#39;m currently getting codescouts into a CMS and will hopefully have that wrapped up shortly. Once that&#39;s done, I&#39;ll start looking at other screencasts to do. I&#39;m thinking that I may even screencast creating the custom theme in WordPress. My Javascript training will continue and I&#39;m hoping I can dedicate much more time to it this month.</p>
  
  <p>Thanks for reading! May is a long month, so let&#39;s see what I can accomplish in the next 31 days.</p>
