  <p><em>During 2013 I&#39;m going to keep a regular blog series where I summarize what I&#39;ve been working on during the past month. I have reminders set on my calendar and everything, so I&#39;ll never miss one, right?</em></p>
  
  <p>Work has been incredibly busy and continues to be a lot of fun. It&#39;s a good time to be a web developer. There&#39;s plenty of projects to be worked on and I&#39;m enjoying all the little problems I&#39;m faced with solving everyday. I&#39;m also incredibly lucky to work with such a great group of people. Very thankful for being where I am.</p>
  
  <h2><em>Denver Code Club</em></h2>
  
  <p>My <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Denver-Code-Club/">meetup group</a> feels like its hit its stride. We meet every Saturday morning and typically spend about 3 hours studying JavaScript together. I definitely have a better grip on JS today than I did 5 weeks ago, which is an awesome feeling to have.</p>
  
  <p>It&#39;s also been a good excuse for me to get out of the house and meet other developers here in Denver. This is the fourth time in my life that I&#39;ve moved to a completely new city without knowing anyone. Each time I do it, it gets easier to meet people. Denver feels like &#39;home&#39;.</p>
  
  <h2>Writing</h2>
  
  <p>I wrote an <a href="http://themetaq.com/articles/the-pros-and-cons-of-using-a-front-end-framework">article</a> earlier this month about some pros and cons I&#39;ve discovered while working with front end frameworks. They&#39;re great in some situations, but I&#39;ve found that building my own &#39;framework&#39; is a much better solution.</p>
  
  <h2><em>Interview</em></h2>
  
  <p>I was <a href="http://themetaq.com/articles/statamic-series-matt-steele">interviewed</a> on Meta Q about my experiences using the flat file CMS Statamic. It&#39;s a fantastic platform and I&#39;m really lucky to be working at a place that allows me to build on it. I think it has a great future ahead of it and I&#39;m looking forward to building some themes.</p>
  
  <h2>Looking forward</h2>
  
  <p>December will see me continue the meetup and wrap it up just before Christmas. I&#39;ve also been working to get a Statamic theme ready for the launch of <a href="http://trading-post.statamic.com/">The Trading Post</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Wow, December already...</p>
