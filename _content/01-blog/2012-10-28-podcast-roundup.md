  <p>I&#39;ve been listening to a pretty healthy amount of podcasts lately. Mostly the result of not having a TV and having time during the day where I&#39;m working on mindless tasks. I&#39;m always fascinated by seeing what other people fill their time with, so here is my current podcast list pulled from Instacast on my phone.</p>
  
  <p>This list shifts constantly along with what my interests are at the time. I recently went through and deleted a lot of stuff I just wasn&#39;t listening to anymore, which was mostly podcasts about local indie music, baseball and video games.&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>Here&#39;s my current list by category, but in no particular order:</p>
  
  <p><strong>Web Development</strong></p>
  
  <h2><a href="http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow">The Big Web Show</a></h2>
  
  <p>Zeldman. It&#39;s Jeffrey Zeldman and it&#39;s great. He&#39;s a much better interviewer today than he was a year ago. He seems more comfortable.</p>
  
  <h2><a href="http://theeastwing.net/">The East Wing</a></h2>
  
  <p>Tim Smith is fantastic at letting his podcast breath. He&#39;s great at asking a question and letting the guest talk for a while without being interrupted, which is a gift. Sometimes podcasts hosts can drive the show a little too much, and I feel like Tim lets the show go where the guests take it. His lineup has been stellar from the start. A current favorite.</p>
  
  <h2><a href="http://5by5.tv/webahead">The Web Ahead</a></h2>
  
  <p>Jen Simmons has a a perfect radio voice and always interesting topics. The recent Web Behind shows with Eric Meyer have been a good listen as well. A longtime favorite.</p>
  
  <h2><a href="http://unmatchedstyle.com/bizcraft">Bizcraft</a></h2>
  
  <p>Good general advice for business or freelancers.</p>
  
  <h2><a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/">Shop Talk Show</a></h2>
  
  <p>This is one of the best shows out there because it talks nuts and bolts web development. Where other shows talk a lot about bigger picture stuff in web development, Chris and Dave talk about actual code. I always look forward to listening to this show on Thursdays.</p>
  
  <h2><a href="http://younggunsshow.com/">Young Guns Show</a></h2>
  
  <p>It&#39;s always interesting to learn from the younger designers and developers. Excellent podcast. These young guys are so talented and fun to listen to.</p>
  
  <h2><a href="http://atxwebshow.com/">The ATX Web Show</a></h2>
  
  <p>I&#39;ve never lived in Austin, but I listen to this Austin-based podcast because of Dave Rupert.</p>
  
  <h2><a href="http://railscasts.com/">RailsCasts</a></h2>
  
  <p>On my things-to-learn list is Ruby. I listen and watch to learn.</p>
  
  <h2><a href="http://www.pagebreakpodcast.com/">Pagebreak Podcast</a></h2>
  
  <p>Short format, which is such a welcome change from the longer shows listed above. They read a book or article or podcast and chat about it for 10 or 15 minutes. I really like that I don&#39;t have to set an hour aside to listen to this show. Very thoughful discussions and I always listen to it as soon as it pops up with a new show in Instacast.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Sci-Fi</strong></p>
  
  <h2><a href="http://escapepod.org/">Escape Pod</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.starshipsofa.com/">StarShipSofa</a></h2>
  
  <p>I tend to consume my Sci-Fi stories in audio book format, rather than actual books. I listen to both of these podcasts as soon as a new episode is released. I&#39;ll usually set my phone by my head at night and listen to them in the dark before I fall asleep. Fantastic Sci-Fi.&nbsp;</p>
  
  <h2><a href="http://www.startalkradio.net/">StarTalk Radio Show</a></h2>
  
  <p>Neil deGrasse Tyson talks about the cosmos for the layman. Well produced and a wealth of knowledge.</p>
  
  <h2><a href="http://www.swordandlaser.com/">Sword &amp; Laser</a></h2>
  
  <p>I&#39;ve been listening to Tom Merrit and Veronica Belmont for years now. I used to work down the street from the CNet offices in San Francisco and followed their shows there. They started this geek book club and I&#39;ve always been a fan. I don&#39;t ever actually read along with what books they&#39;re reading in their book club, but they&#39;re just fun to listen to.</p>
  
  <h2><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/starstuff/">StarStuff with Stuart Gary</a></h2>
  
  <p>Science! Real science that&#39;s honestly often over my head since it can go into physics, but I listen nonetheless. If Startalk with Neil deGrasse Tyson is for the layman, this show is just the opposite. I listen to make myself smarter...or try at least.</p>
  
  <h2><a href="http://galacticwatercooler.com/">Galactic Watercooler</a></h2>
  
  <p>I usually don&#39;t make it through a whole show because they&#39;re so long. Three friends sitting around talking Sci-Fi.</p>
  
  <h2><a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/videos/archive/category/hubblecast/">Hubblecast</a></h2>
  
  <p>This is not a podcast, but videocast. You can listen to people talk about all the cool space stuff, but this is where you get to actually see the pictures that are coming back from Hubble. Truly fascinating to see images that are essentially star systems from the past and as far out as humans have ever seen.</p>
  
  <p>General&nbsp;</p>
  
  <h2><a href="http://themoth.org/">The Moth&nbsp;</a></h2>
  
  <p>The old standby for short stories. I always listen to these right away</p>
  
  <h2><a href="http://www.radiolab.org/">RadioLab</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href="http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/hsw-shows/stuff-you-should-know-podcast.htm">Stuff You Should Know</a></h2>
  
  <p>Also in my que for a few years now.&nbsp;</p>
  
  <h2><a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/all-songs-considered/">All Songs Considered</a></h2>
  
  <p>Ah, well, I knew the day would come when I got all my music info from NPR. I used to follow the local music scene so closely and know about every new band to come onto the scene in SF. I had friends in bands and listened to podcasts, and visited websites, and went to the all the latest shows and festivals. Now I just flip this show on once a week and that&#39;s it. It&#39;s funny how priorities and interests evolve in life. I&#39;m now completely disconnected from what the kids are listening to, and I&#39;m perfectly OK with that.</p>
  
  <h2><a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/">Planet Money</a></h2>
  
  <p>Very informative and often humerous stories. A little insight into the world of finance.</p>
