  <p>After relying on jQuery for a while, I&#39;ve recently started to dive into pure JavaScript. It&#39;s been a HUGE turn for me. I&#39;ve always wanted to understand Javascript; not jQuery, but <em>Javascript</em>.</p>
  
  <p>Maybe you&#39;ll get your Ah-ha! moment here, or maybe you&#39;ll get it somewhere else, but learning to write code is full of these moments, and once you get your first few, they start coming like an avalanche.</p>
  
  <p>I&#39;ve been watching for these &#39;a-ha&#39; moments ever since I read <a href="http://css-tricks.com/the-javascript-ah-ha-moment/">Chris Coyier&#39;s article</a>&nbsp;way back in March of 2012.</p>
  
  <p>(This next part is going to be really nerdy!)</p>
  
  <p>I was at a book signing for a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brandon-Sanderson/e/B001IGFHW6">fantasy author</a>&nbsp;the other night (see) and he was signing books in an order based on a number you were given when you bought the book. I was number 438 out of 480, which meant I had about 5 hours to kill before I was going to get my book signed. What to do for five hours in a book store on a weeknight? I went to the computer section and started reading each of the Javascript books on the shelves.</p>
  
  <p>In hindsight I&#39;m really glad I got these five hours to sit and do nothing but sample books. It was an opportunity to give them a thorough read through. Not just flipping through the pages and putting them back on the shelf, but really reading each one of them. I learned a lot about how I learn, and what my level is.</p>
  
  <p>After all that reading, the one book that stood out and helped me to finally understand Javascript and give me so many a-ha! moments is <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027713.do">Javascript Enlightenment</a> by Cody Lindley. This book has been a revelation, and is <a href="http://www.javascriptenlightenment.com/">completely free</a>&nbsp;in PDF if you prefer to read that way.</p>
  
  <p>In chapter one:</p>
  
  <p>&quot;Methods are properties that contain a function object, whose intent is to operate on the object the function that is contained within.&quot;</p>
  
  <p>I&#39;ve read that sentence no less than twenty times now. It makes sense! How come no one explained it to me that way before? The truth is, that of course I&#39;ve read this idea before, just in different ways by other authors. For some reason though, this description made it click for me.</p>
  
  <p>Here&#39;s another quote I&#39;ve re-read numerous times, again from chapter one. This makes constructor functions easy to understand:</p>
  
  <p>&quot;The role of a constructor function is to create multiple objects that share certain qualities and behaviors. Basically a constructor function is a cookie cutter for producing objects that have default properties and property methods.&quot;</p>
  
  <p>There&#39;s a lot of book recommendations out there for all skill levels, but I think this book is perfect for the person who has CSS, HTML and jQuery down, but just needs that little extra explanation to start &#39;getting&#39; Javascript, at least it has been for me.</p>
  
  <p>Learning to understand any new language is hard, but you know that, of course. It&#39;s hard for me too, but the path is getting easier to navigate everyday.</p>
  
  <p>Another revelation I&#39;ve had is that understanding one language makes the others not seem so foreign anymore. Because I&#39;m now understanding Javascript, I&#39;m also understanding Ruby and really starting to appreciate how pretty it is.</p>
  
  <p>If you&#39;re trying to learn Javascript, this book is my recommendation to start with. Maybe you won&#39;t get it here. That&#39;s ok though, keep trying other books, I certainly did. Once you find the teacher who&#39;s voice you understand, you&#39;ll start to get it, I promise.</p>
  
  <p>Yesterday, Rachel Nabors posted an <a href="http://www.rachelnabors.com/2013/01/javascript-study-for-designers/">article</a> that I agreed with from top to bottom and sounded a lot like the path I&#39;ve been on. Reading that is what prompted me to write this, so please follow the link and check out her post as well (thank you, Rachel).</p>
