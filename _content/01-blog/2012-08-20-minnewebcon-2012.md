  <p>A new week and a new web conference. This time it was MinneWebCon held over at The University of Minnesota.</p>
  
  <p>This was quite a different feel from the huge (and excellent) MinneBar that I went to a few weeks ago that had well over 1000 people. MinneWebCon is much smaller, which I appreciated a lot. Great speakers all around as well. It was a good mix of both nuts and bolts tech talk and more general web related talk. I sat in on some good sessions about responsive design, new CSS3 properties and project management.</p>
  
  <p>Mostly, it was just nice to get out and meet some people in my new city.</p>
  
  <p>All-in-all a good conference and a day well spent.</p>
