  <p>I recently launched a new site for my screencasts at <a href="http://codescouts.net">codescouts.net</a>. I decided to screencast for a few different reasons, and I&nbsp;hope others start to do the same more often.</p>
  
  <p>Here's a few of the reasons I've decided to screencast:</p>
  
  <h2>Teach to learn</h2>
  
  <p>Code Scouts gives me an opportunity to teach, which I've been wanting to do for a while. There's no better way to learn something&nbsp;than to be able to teach it to others. When I first started learning web development I remember the fog of the unknown being very&nbsp;thick. There's so many acronyms, and technologies, and people saying that there were 'right' ways to do things. It could be a bit confusing. So, this first screencast is simply a way to break from that noise and shows the basic to a beginner. I'm enjoying the process, although I'm still trying to get used to the sound of my own voice.</p>
  
  <h2>Watching others work</h2>
  
  <p>This is an old tried and true way to learn. I've never built a wood hutch, but I've certainly watched episodes of This Old&nbsp;House. The same can be said for the 100's of hours of cooking shows I watched. I've long been a consumer of watching others code. No&nbsp;two people ever code exactly the same way, and there's a lot to be picked up on in the subtleties of others peoples workflow.</p>
  
  <h2>Back to editing</h2>
  
  <p>I went to film school and a had a career in post-production for a while. I used to spend HOURS in editing booths. Late nights alone&nbsp;with just myself, the monitors and a bunch of footage. I loved it. A lot like coding, it's really easy to lose hours working on an&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">editing project. I didn't realize how much I missed it. If you're a developer who's never cut footage before, I think you should&nbsp;</span>give it a shot.&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>Although screencasting has very simple editing involved, I was still excited just to get back to some software that felt like an old&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3em;">friend. Of course, the software has evolved over time, so it took me a few minutes to get familiar with the new parts, but the&nbsp;</span>underlying process is the same as it ever was. Like riding a bike.</p>
  
  <h2>You should try screencasting</h2>
  
  <p>I'd love to see more people try screencasting. It's not only a great way to learn, but you'll likely help others out as well. The more&nbsp;we share, and learn our each other developers workflows, the better we'll be.</p>
  
  <p>So, if you have a minute, head over to <a href="http://codescouts.net">codescouts.net</a> and watch me work. You can compare/contrast against your own workflow, watch me make mistakes and correct them. You may even learn a thing or two, I certainly do whenever I watch someone else work. I've got the intro video up and plan on releasing more in the coming weeks.</p>
