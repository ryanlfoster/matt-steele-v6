  <p><em>I was interviewed recently about my career change. You can learn more about me and my path from TV to the web on <a href="http://theeastwing.net">The East Wing</a>.</em></p>
  
  <h2>Work hard and be nice to people.</h2>
  
  <p>You can do it. You can absolutely do it. People have been switching careers since careers have been around. It takes a lot of work,&nbsp;but you already know that. It's Monday morning right now, and Mondays can be especially hard. You've spent all weekend working&nbsp;towards your new career, pouring your heart into it. Learning. Building.</p>
  
  <p>...then Monday comes and it can be really, really hard to get out of bed, put on those clothes, and head out to your current job. You're already mentally checked out. You're just putting in the hours and watching the clock until you can finally get home and work on your projects...or just get some sleep. Your job represents the old you, but you're reinventing yourself. I get it. But please don't give up. Keep hustling. The work that you do in your "spare" time will one day be your life's work. One day you'll be proud of the work you do.</p>
  
  <p>Reach out to people. Don't be an island. I'll tell you right now that most people will simply ignore you. It can be a bit heartbreaking to write a sincere email to someone you admire and get nothing back, or even worse, a simple "Thanks, dude". But don't give up. There are some genuinely nice people in the industry you're shooting for, and you'll find them eventually. People are busy, but someone will believe in you and give you a shot. Don't be discouraged. Keep reaching out.</p>
  
  <p>I have so much admiration for you. It takes a lot of guts to say that what you once thought was your path in life is no longer the path you want to follow anymore. It's almost like you're admitting you were wrong. But you were never wrong. All of that experience you have will pay off in spades in your new career. You have perspective, which I would have dismissed as "things old people say" when I was younger, but it's 100% true. You have perspective. When you finally do land that first job in your new career, you'll give so much more to it that you ever would have without the perspective of your previous career. You'll appreciate it more than you ever could have in your early 20's.</p>
  
  <p>This will pass. Keep working hard and be nice to people.</p>
  
  <p>Happy Monday.</p>
