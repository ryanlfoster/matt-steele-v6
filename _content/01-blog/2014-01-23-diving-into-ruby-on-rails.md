  <p>Up until this point in my career I&#39;ve pretty much stuck to the front end of web development. This was a conscious decision&nbsp;when I first started out. I knew that there were two distinct paths you could follow:&nbsp;the front&nbsp;end or the back end, and both have always appealed to me.</p>
  
  <p>Ultimately, I went with the&nbsp;front&nbsp;end because of the immediate satisfaction I got when I created a style and watched it suddenly appear on a page. This is possible in the back end too of course, but that side always contained &#39;THE&nbsp;DATABASE&#39;, which seemed so inaccessible when I was first learning web development. &quot;Thar be Dragons in there. Don&#39;t touch it&quot;, I told myself.</p>
  
  <p>So&nbsp;the front&nbsp;end is where I focused my attention.&nbsp;CSS(Sass),&nbsp;HTML,&nbsp;JavaScript and a few CMS&#39;s. There&#39;s plenty there alone to keep you learning for a lifetime, especially JavaScript. Along the way though I&#39;ve dabbled in getting to know some back end technologies. Plenty of PHP&nbsp;meetups (and even a PHP conference) and a few courses on Ruby.</p>
  
  <p>Ahhh...Ruby. Every time I ran across that nice, clean syntax I told myself &quot;I&#39;m going to learn Rails someday&quot;.</p>

  <p>Luckily, at my job we work on a few Rails apps, so I get to play around a bit. I&nbsp;mostly I stick to the &#39;views&#39; folder (again, there&#39;s Dragons in the other folders). My co-wroker, <a href="http://themetaq.com/queue/contributor/6">Clinton</a>, is a master of the&nbsp;back end technologies.&nbsp;He knows his way backwards and forwards through Rails, so I tend to ask a lot of questions and he&#39;s always willing to answer them for me. Slowly, four Rails apps are becoming my responsibility, and we have another that&#39;s about to go into development. I recognized right away that <em>now</em> is my opportunity to finally dive into Rails. Score. I&#39;m ready.</p>
  
  <p>On the advice of the entire internet, I picked up <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book?version=3.2">Ruby On Rails Tutorial</a> by Michael Hartl and started from the beginning. I&#39;ve just wrapped up Chapter 1, which gets a surprisingly lot done in a single chapter. I&#39;ve created an app, put it into <a href="https://github.com/mattsteele/first_app">version control</a>, and deployed it to the web. It does absolutely nothing (you can find it <a href="http://mattsteele-firstrailsapp.herokuapp.com/">here</a>), but it lays the ground work for what&#39;s to come. More specifically, it lays the groundwork of learning &quot;the right way&quot;&nbsp;to develop by using a combo of version control and test&nbsp;driven development.</p>
  
  <p>I&#39;m extremely excited to get going through the rest of the book and getting more involved with the apps we have at work. To use a video game analogy, <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/fog-of-war/3015-14/">the fog of the war</a>&nbsp;is beginning to dissipate and there&#39;s no better feeling. There's far less Dragons than I anticipated.</p>

  <p>Learning a new language/framework is always exciting.&nbsp;I&#39;ll update here as I go along. The book should take me about 4-6 weeks to get through, and in the end I hope I can call myself a novice Rails developer. The work that&#39;s coming up for me at my job should help me become well aquatinted before too long as well. Maybe turning me into a full-fledged Rails developer eventually.</p>
