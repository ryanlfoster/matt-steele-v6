    The Minneapolis Millers were a minor-league baseball team that played prior to the arrival of the Twins in Minnesota. In 1884 the Millers began playing in the Northwestern League, which consisted of eight teams in Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Minnesota, which, besides Minneapolis, was represented by teams in St. Paul, Stillwater, and, later in the season, Winona.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through the remainder of the 19th century, the Millers played in a variety of different leagues. In 1902, they became charter members in a new league, the American Association. Over the 59 years the Millers played in the Association, they compiled the best won-lost record of all the teams in the league. The second-best record over that span belonged to the St. Paul Saints.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ballparks of the Millers and Saints (Nicollet Park in Minneapolis and Lexington Park in St. Paul) were only seven miles apart. The teams had a great rivalry, highlighted by the holiday doubleheaders. On Decoration Day, fourth of July, and Labor Day, the teams played a morning-afternoon doubleheader with games at the two different parks.*

    The Minneapolis Millers had a number of locales to hang their hats during their nearly eighty years of professional baseball: the original park at the corner of Chicago Avenue and 17th Street, in the days when handlebar mustaches were in vogue; another in the vicinity of the Milwaukee railroad shops; the band box in back of the West Hotel downtown; Minnehaha Driving Park, and a field in White Bear Lake for Sunday games; and eventually Metropolitan Stadium. But the park most closely associated with the Millers was the one described by former Minneapolis Tribune writer Dave Mona as “soggy, foul, rotten and thoroughly wonderful Nicollet Park."

  <p>
    Built at a cost of $4,000 to seat 4,000 fans, Nicollet Park, in its first season as well as its last, was home to a pennant winner. Also a center for prize fights and high-school football games, Nicollet is best remembered for its short right-field fence, only 279 feet, 10 inches from home plate.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although the playing area at Nicollet Park seemed spacious when in opened in 1896—especially in contrast to tiny Athletic Park, where the Minneapolis Millers had moved from—soon enough the ballpark at the corner of 31st Street and Nicollet Avenue acquired its own reputation as a bandbox.

     <h2 class="player-header"> Willie Mays, Outfielder, 1951</h2>
  <p>
    The Millers were picked to win the American Association pennant 1951, largely because of a new center fielder who, it was assumed, would spend the entire season in Minneapolis before graduating to the majors. But the New York Giants decided they needed Willie Mays sooner than that, and, in May, Minneapolis saw its new hero disappear before most fans even had a chance to see him play.
  </p>
  <p>
    His statistics with the Millers make it obvious why the Giants couldn’t wait: a .477 average, eight home runs, 30 RBIs and 38 runs scored in 35 games. Mays nearly single-handedly carried the Millers through the first month of the season as the Millers won 21 of those games.

  <h2 class="player-header">Ted Williams, Outfielder, 1938</h2>
  <p>
    In 1938 Ted Williams made Minneapolis his final pit stop en route to Fenway Park and a Hall of Fame career with the Red Sox. As a nineteen-year-old in his second season of pro ball, Williams became the first player to min the American Association Triple Crown, hitting .366 with 43 home runs and 142 RBIs, leading the league in runs, total bases, and walks, as well. He was a unanimous selection as the starting right fielder in the Association All-Star Game in July.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the Millers, Williams survived two wars to hit 521 home runs with the Red Sox, twice winning the American League Triple Crown and compiling a lifetime batting average of .344. His election to the Hall of Fame came in 1966.
